Case study 1 - Segmentation and Clustering Neighbourhood in Bangalore City

In this project, we will use the Foursquare API to explore neighborhoods in Bangalore City. We will use the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. We will use the k-means clustering algorithm to complete this task. Finally, We will use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in Bangalore City and their emerging clusters.
